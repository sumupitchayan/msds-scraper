# msds-scraper

In the summer of 2018, I interned on the Business Development team of a company called the Smilist Management, a Dental Service Organization (DSO) based in the Long Island / NYC area. 

While most of my work dealt with M&A activities (analyzing census data to find target locations, attending meetings with potential dental practice sellers, carrying out due diligence/modeling tax return data for deals on Excel), I was also challenged with other roles that allowed me to make an impact on the company as a whole; one of which was compiling a database of MSDS files.

Dental practices are required by law to have an MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet) archive on hand in the event a patient has an allergic reaction to a product; the problem was, none of the Smilist practices had this archive on them, which posed a huge threat to the rapidly growing company's reputation. Therefore, I was tasked with putting together a folder of these MSDS files together that would be shared and used across all 19 dental practice locations in an event of an emergency.

This task was initially given to me as 'busy work' for the intern to do; what my boss was really expecting me to do was go through the Henry Schein website for each practice and download and rename each file by hand to its ID# and Product Name.

However, I knew that this process would have taken me weeks .. (and probably have driven me mad ...). So, I decided to put my programming knowledge to use by writing a Python script to automate the process (something I had never done before).

In the end, I was able to achieve the task and cut down about 2 weeks' worth of menial labor into 2 days with productive programming. I learned so much through this process and gained more confidence in my ability to use programming as a means to make everyday life easier and solve problems more efficiently.
