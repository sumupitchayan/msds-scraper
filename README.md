# msds-scraper

In the summer of 2018, I interned on the Business Development team of a company at a Dental Service Organization based in the NYC area. 

While most of my work dealt with M&A activities (analyzing census data to find target locations, attending meetings with potential dental practice sellers, carrying out due diligence/modeling tax return data for deals on Excel), I was also challenged with other roles that allowed me to make an impact on the company as a whole; one of which was compiling a database of MSDS files.

Dental practices are required by law to have an MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet) archive on hand in the event a patient has an allergic reaction to a product; the problem was, none of the company's practices had this archive on them, which posed a huge legal threat to the company. Therefore, I was tasked with putting together a folder of these MSDS files together that would be shared and used across all 19 dental practice locations in an event of an emergency.

This task was initially given to me as 'busy work' for the intern to do; what my boss was expecting me to do was go through the manufacturer's website for each practice and download and rename each file by hand to its ID# and Product Name. In the end, I was able to achieve the task and cut down about 2 weeks' worth of menial labor into 2 days of productive programming.
